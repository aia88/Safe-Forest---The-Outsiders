# Safe-Forest---The-Outsiders
NASA Space Apps Challenge 2020-Spot that Fire V3.0Our project is a mobile application which provides two separate services, the first is to identify the predicted fires by Satellites, and the app provides an alert service to residents near the expected location where the fire is expected to occur, to alert them several days before it. The second service is for sudden fires, where the one who notices the fire takes an instant picture and publishes it on the app so that all those living in the neighborhood can identify the fire and take the necessary precautions to avoid injury. While the app connects directly to a fire station near the fire, the app connects to NASA Firms while a fire occurs to alert NASA to take the necessary measures.
